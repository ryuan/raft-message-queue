I worked on the whole project on my own. Though this was a tough project, I was happy to tackle and solve problems from beginning to end to get a more thorough understanding of Raft.

### Sources:

Some of the classes such as `ResettableTimer` and functions such as `parse_config_json` were taken from Max's Raft code.
